\chapter*{Declaration of authorship}
I hereby certify that the material, which I now submit for assessment on the programmes of study leading to the award of Master of Science, is entirely my own work and has not been taken from the work of others except to the extent that such work has been cited and acknowledged within the text of my own work. No portion of the work contained in this thesis has been submitted in support of an application for another degree or qualification to this or any other institution.
