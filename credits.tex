\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

This thesis would not have been possible without the support of many people. I would like to express my
sincere gratitude to:

\begin{itemize}
\item  My supervisor, who was abundantly helpful and offered invaluable advice,
assistance and support throughout my studies in ITT.
\item  My parents.
\item  My countries (both of them).  
\end{itemize}
